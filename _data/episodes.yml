  title: When Coding Isn't Enough
  date: '2026-01-27'
  description: 'AI is eating into the value of "just coding", so what do you do about
    it? Colleen and Joe talk through how they''re each adapting: AI-enabled services,
    getting more strategic with clients, and actually understanding what non-tech
    businesses need (not just what they say they want). Plus: cold outreach experiments,
    product ideas, and some financial housekeeping.Takeaways:When coding becomes commoditized,
    strategy becomes the differentiatorCold outreach isn''t deadThe best opportunities
    come from understanding the business problem, not just the technical oneChapters:00:00
